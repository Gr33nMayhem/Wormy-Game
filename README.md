A game of filling in the blanks .Providing a gaming interface to make the boring arithmatic operation appear to be super fun and addictive.

The game can run independently as a **.py** application or can be run on a **Sugar PC**.

The game requires the players to move his worm around and eat apple, just a classic old 'snake' like game, but there is a twist, each apple is marked with an answer in it with only one apple having theright answer written on it. The right answer for the question printed on top of the game screen when eaten by the worm grants the player a score. If not, the game ends.

As the worm eats more and more apple, it will grow a unit block longer. If the worm ends up eating its own tail, the game ends.
